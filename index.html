                    10% of your final grade! Or 10 points.
                    It will be applied to whatever assignment you currently have the lowest grade on,
                    between HM#1 and the music mixer check in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, your final grade might look confusing; If it gets applied to the music mixer
                    check in, you could get end up with a "perfect" grade, since that assignment is worth 10%
                    of your final grade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, if your lowest grade is HM#1, the "highest" your grade will be converted to is 50%,
                    since HM#1 is worth 20%, or 20 points of your final grade.

                    If you don't think you can complete this in a week, then your grades will stay as they are.
